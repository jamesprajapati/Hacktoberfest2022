## Introduction to the Awesome World of Cypress automation

### What is Cypress?
Cypress automation is the latest front-end testing standard that every developer and QA engineer should know about. It is a cutting-edge front-end automated testing solution for modern web applications.

Cypress is mainly used for:

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End flow Testing
- Nonetheless, it can be used for functional testing as well.

Although Cypress is frequently compared to Selenium, the two are fundamentally and structurally distinct.

The nice part is that we can get rid of those Browser Drivers in Cypress 


### Why Cypress and How it is different from Selenium? Magical Spells of Cypress….

- Fast, Consistent, Effortless, and Reliable: In comparison to the Selenium tool, Cypress delivers faster, consistent, effortless, and reliable test execution due to - - its architectural design, as the test runs directly inside the browser without the use of a browser driver.
- Automatic Waiting: There’s no need to include Waits and Sleep in your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions. There will be no more asynchronization.
- Time Travel: We can hover over each command in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step. In contrast to other automation tools, we can see and debug each step in the log while the tests are running.
- Easy debugging: Cypress’s Developer Tools make debugging simple. Debugging is quick and painless thanks to the errors and stack trace. The error messages are very readable and explain why our script failed.
- Cypress has a test status menu that displays the number of test cases that have passed or failed.
- Cypress reloads all updates made in the tests by default.
- Screenshot and Videos: By default, Cypress can capture screenshots in the event of a failure. It can also record videos of the entire test suite running from the - -- command line interface. When we run our tests from the Cypress Dashboard, we can watch videos of the entire process.
- Single easy universal Language: Because its architecture is based on Node JS, it only works with JavaScript, which is very simple to learn. JavaScript is extremely -- simple to work with for both developers and testers.
-Multiple browser support: It supports Chrome, Edge, Electron (default browser comes with Cypress and it run in headless mode) and Firefox (Still in under construction).
- API Testing support: Cypress can perform HTTP calls; thus, we can test APIs as well.
- External Plugin supports: Cypress supports external plugins to widen the test coverage.
